# Performance TODO

This document outlines the current performance optimization opportunities for Dosatsu C++.

## Optimization Priorities

### Priority 1: System Call Optimization ðŸŽ¯ HIGH IMPACT

**Target**: ntdll.dll operations (31.4% average CPU usage)  
**Impact**: Second largest performance bottleneck with high optimization potential

**Investigation Required**:
- [ ] Profile memory allocation patterns to identify hotspots
- [ ] Investigate file I/O efficiency and caching opportunities  
- [ ] Review string operations for optimization potential
- [ ] Analyze system call patterns using memory profiling tools

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce ntdll.dll CPU usage by 25-35% (target: <23%)
- Improve memory allocation efficiency across all example types

### Priority 2: Debug Runtime Optimization ðŸ”§ DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE

**Target**: Debug runtime overhead (15.6% combined debug libraries)  
**Impact**: Development experience and iteration speed improvement

**Investigation Required**:
- [ ] Research optimized debug configurations that preserve debugging capabilities
- [ ] Document recommended development build configurations
- [ ] Test performance impact of different debug optimization levels

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce debug runtime overhead by 20-30% while maintaining debugging capabilities
- Improve development build performance

## Investigation Phase: System Resource Analysis

### Memory Allocation Investigation ðŸ“‹ READY TO START

**Objective**: Understand what's driving the 31.4% ntdll.dll usage

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Memory allocation profiling using heap profiling tools
- [ ] System call tracing to identify specific bottlenecks
- [ ] Correlation analysis between system calls and processing phases
- [ ] Identify memory allocation patterns that can be optimized

### Implementation Phase (Future)

**System-Level Optimizations**:
- [ ] Implement memory allocation improvements based on profiling results
- [ ] Optimize file I/O operations based on investigation findings
- [ ] Improve string processing efficiency where identified
- [ ] Validate system call reduction through measurement

**Debug Build Optimizations**:
- [ ] Research and implement optimized debug configurations
- [ ] Document recommended development build settings
- [ ] Validate debugging capabilities are preserved

## Performance Monitoring (Future Enhancement)

### Continuous Performance Tracking
- [ ] Integrate performance testing into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Establish performance regression alerts and thresholds
- [ ] Document optimization guidelines for future development

## Available Tools and Commands

### Profiling Commands
```bash
# Profile all examples
python Examples/run_examples.py --profile

# Profile specific example
python Examples/run_examples.py --profile --example simple

# Analyze profiling results
