# Performance Optimization Status

Current status of performance optimizations for Dosatsu C++.

## Implemented Optimizations

### Database Operations - Complete
All major database performance optimizations have been implemented and validated:

**Bulk Node Operations**
- Multi-node CREATE statements processing up to 50 nodes per query
- Intelligent query parsing and grouping by node type
- Automatic fallback for complex queries that cannot be batched

**Schema-Aware Relationship Batching**  
- UNWIND-based bulk relationship creation with proper node type validation
- Support for 18+ relationship types with correct FROM/TO constraints (CFG_EDGE, HAS_TYPE, etc.)
- Boolean property handling with automatic type conversion
- Schema-aware fallback when bulk operations fail

**Transaction Optimization**
- Batch size increased from 150 to 500 operations
- Transaction commit threshold increased from 1000 to 5000 operations  
- Clean transaction management with zero warnings

**Additional Features**
- CSV bulk import capability for very large datasets
- Connection pooling infrastructure ready for future use
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Current Performance Impact

The implemented optimizations have transformed database operations from individual query execution to efficient bulk processing:

- **Node creation**: Individual CREATE statements → Multi-node bulk CREATE
- **Relationship creation**: Individual MATCH...CREATE → UNWIND bulk operations  
- **Transaction management**: Frequent small commits → Large batched transactions
- **Error handling**: Clean execution with zero warnings or failures

## Future Optimization Opportunities

### Debug Runtime Optimization
**Target**: Debug runtime overhead (15.6% combined debug libraries)
- Research optimized debug configurations preserving debugging capabilities
- Document recommended development build configurations  
- Test performance impact of different debug optimization levels

### Additional Database Enhancements
- Prepared statement implementation for repeated query patterns
- Query result caching for frequently accessed data
- Connection pooling utilization optimization

## Testing and Validation

All optimizations have been validated across multiple example categories:
- Simple examples: Basic node and relationship operations
- Template examples: Complex template-related relationships
- Inheritance examples: INHERITS_FROM relationships with boolean properties

All tests execute cleanly with zero errors or warnings.

## Implementation Examples

**Bulk Node Creation**
```cpp
// Before: Individual queries
CREATE (n:ASTNode {node_id: 1, ...})
CREATE (n:ASTNode {node_id: 2, ...})

// After: Bulk operations  
CREATE (n1:ASTNode {node_id: 1, ...}), (n2:ASTNode {node_id: 2, ...})
```

**Schema-Aware Relationships**
```cpp
// UNWIND-based bulk relationship creation with proper node types
UNWIND [{from_id: 1, to_id: 2, is_virtual: true}] AS rel
MATCH (from:Declaration {node_id: rel.from_id}), (to:Declaration {node_id: rel.to_id})
CREATE (from)-[:INHERITS_FROM {is_virtual: rel.is_virtual}]->(to)
```
