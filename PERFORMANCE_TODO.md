# Performance TODO

This document describes the remaining work in our performance optimization project and the active commitments we have made.

## Immediate Action Plan

Based on our profiling results, we have identified three priority areas for optimization:

### Priority 1: Database Performance Investigation ðŸ”„ ACTIVE

**Target**: kuzu_shared.dll (42.00% CPU usage)  
**Impact**: Highest potential performance gain

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Profile database query patterns and transactions in detail
  - Analyze which specific database operations are consuming CPU time
  - Identify if queries are inefficient or if there are too many queries
- [ ] Investigate batch vs. individual operations
  - Determine if we can batch multiple operations together
  - Review transaction handling and commit frequency
- [ ] Review database schema efficiency
  - Analyze if current schema design is optimal for our query patterns
  - Consider index optimization for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Consider connection pooling and caching strategies
  - Investigate if database connections are being reused efficiently
  - Explore caching frequently accessed data to reduce database hits

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce kuzu_shared.dll CPU usage by at least 50% (target: <21%)
- Improve overall application performance by 20-30%

### Priority 2: Debug Build Optimization ðŸ”„ ACTIVE

**Target**: Debug runtime overhead (13.39% combined)  
**Impact**: Medium performance gain, high development experience improvement

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Test release build performance comparison
