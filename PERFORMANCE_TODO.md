# Performance TODO

This document describes the remaining work in our performance optimization project and the active commitments we have made.

## Immediate Action Plan

Based on our profiling results, we have identified three priority areas for optimization:

### Priority 1: Database Performance Investigation 🔄 ACTIVE

**Target**: kuzu_shared.dll (43.7% average CPU usage across all examples)  
**Impact**: Highest potential performance gain - universally consistent bottleneck

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Profile database query patterns and transactions in detail
  - Analyze which specific database operations are consuming CPU time
  - Identify if queries are inefficient or if there are too many queries
- [ ] Investigate batch vs. individual operations
  - Determine if we can batch multiple operations together
  - Review transaction handling and commit frequency
- [ ] Review database schema efficiency
  - Analyze if current schema design is optimal for our query patterns
  - Consider index optimization for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Consider connection pooling and caching strategies
  - Investigate if database connections are being reused efficiently
  - Explore caching frequently accessed data to reduce database hits

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce kuzu_shared.dll CPU usage by at least 50% (target: <22%)
- Improve overall application performance by 20-30%
- Maintain consistent optimization benefits across all C++ code complexity levels

### Priority 2: System Call Optimization 🔄 ACTIVE

**Target**: ntdll.dll operations (31.0% average across all examples)  
**Impact**: High performance gain potential - second largest consistent bottleneck

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Profile memory allocation patterns in detail
  - Analyze heap allocation frequency and patterns across all examples
  - Identify excessive allocations or memory fragmentation
  - Consider memory pool strategies for frequent allocations
  - Investigate why system calls scale linearly with C++ code complexity
- [ ] Investigate file I/O efficiency
  - Profile file operations and disk access patterns
  - Determine if file I/O can be optimized or cached
  - Review temporary file usage and cleanup patterns
  - Analyze if file operations increase with code complexity
- [ ] Review string operations and conversions
  - Analyze string processing overhead in critical paths
  - Identify unnecessary string conversions or copies in AST processing
  - Consider more efficient string handling strategies for C++ identifiers

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce ntdll.dll CPU usage by 25-35% (target: <23%)
- Improve memory allocation efficiency across all example types
- Reduce file I/O overhead while maintaining functionality

### Priority 3: Debug Runtime Optimization 🔄 ACTIVE

**Target**: Debug runtime overhead (15.6% combined: ucrtbase.dll + vcruntime140d.dll + msvcp140d.dll)  
**Impact**: Medium performance gain, high development experience improvement

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Identify debug-specific performance features that can be disabled
  - Research Visual C++ debug runtime options that don't compromise debugging
  - Investigate which debug features can be selectively disabled
  - Test configurations that maintain debugging capabilities while improving performance
- [ ] Consider optimized debug configurations
  - Investigate debug build optimizations that don't compromise debugging our code
  - Document recommended development build configurations
  - Test if debug runtime libraries can be optimized without losing debug capabilities

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce debug runtime overhead by 20-30%
- Maintain full debugging capabilities for our application code
- Document optimal development build configuration for team

## Analysis and Investigation Tasks

### Deep Database Analysis 📋 READY TO START

**Objective**: Understand exactly what kuzu_shared.dll operations are consuming 43.7% of CPU time

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Function-level profiling within kuzu_shared.dll
  - Use detailed stack traces to identify specific database functions
  - Analyze query patterns and transaction overhead
  - Determine if CPU time is in query execution, result processing, or transaction management
- [ ] Database operation tracing
  - Log all database operations during example processing
  - Correlate database operations with CPU usage spikes
  - Identify if there are redundant or inefficient queries
- [ ] Query pattern analysis
  - Review AST insertion patterns and batching opportunities
  - Analyze schema usage and index effectiveness
  - Test if query optimization or caching can reduce database load
- [ ] **Header file duplication analysis** ⚠️ **SUSPECTED HIGH IMPACT**
  - **Hypothesis**: Header files are processed multiple times (once per .cpp file that includes them)
  - Investigate if GlobalDatabaseManager prevents duplicate processing effectively
  - Consider if Clang's translation unit model causes redundant header parsing
  - **Potential Impact**: Could explain why database operations scale with C++ complexity
  - **Solution**: Implement header-aware caching or preprocessing to avoid duplicate AST processing
