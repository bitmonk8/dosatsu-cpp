# Performance TODO

This document describes the remaining work in our performance optimization project and the active commitments we have made.

## Current Status

**Priority 1 Database Performance**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - 40% execution time improvement achieved through batch size optimization, connection pooling, and transaction management. See PERFORMANCE_DONE.md for details.

## Active Priority Areas

### Priority 2: System Call Optimization ðŸ”„ NEXT PRIORITY

**Target**: ntdll.dll operations (31.0% average across all examples)  
**Impact**: Second largest consistent bottleneck - high optimization potential

**Investigation Required**:
- [ ] Profile memory allocation patterns to identify hotspots
- [ ] Investigate file I/O efficiency and caching opportunities  
- [ ] Review string operations for optimization potential

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce ntdll.dll CPU usage by 25-35% (target: <23%)
- Improve memory allocation efficiency across all example types

### Priority 3: Debug Runtime Optimization ðŸ”„ FUTURE CONSIDERATION

**Target**: Debug runtime overhead (15.6% combined debug libraries)  
**Impact**: Development experience improvement

**Investigation Required**:
- [ ] Research optimized debug configurations that preserve debugging capabilities
- [ ] Document recommended development build configurations

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce debug runtime overhead by 20-30% while maintaining debugging capabilities

## Next Investigation Phase

### System Resource Investigation ðŸ“‹ READY TO START

**Objective**: Understand what's driving the 31% ntdll.dll usage

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Memory allocation profiling using heap profiling tools
- [ ] System call tracing to identify specific bottlenecks
- [ ] Correlation analysis between system calls and processing phases

**Note**: Database analysis completed successfully. See PERFORMANCE_DONE.md for detailed results.

## Future Optimization Implementation

### System-Level Optimizations (If Additional Performance Needed)
- [ ] Implement memory allocation improvements based on profiling results
- [ ] Optimize file I/O operations based on investigation findings
- [ ] Improve string processing efficiency where identified
- [ ] Validate system call reduction through measurement

### Debug Build Optimizations (Development Experience)
- [ ] Research and implement optimized debug configurations
- [ ] Document recommended development build settings
- [ ] Validate debugging capabilities are preserved

## Performance Monitoring (Future Enhancement)

### Continuous Performance Tracking
- [ ] Integrate performance testing into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Establish performance regression alerts and thresholds
- [ ] Document optimization guidelines for future development

## Success Criteria Status

### Current Achievement
- **Overall Performance**: âœ… **40% improvement achieved** (exceeded target)
- **Database Optimization**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Primary bottleneck resolved

### Remaining Opportunities (Optional)
- **System Call Efficiency**: ðŸ”„ **INVESTIGATE** - Reduce ntdll.dll usage from 31% 
- **Debug Runtime Optimization**: ðŸ”„ **RESEARCH** - Optimize debug build experience

## Updated Performance Analysis Results (2025-08-27)

âœ… **Fresh profiling data collected** - database optimization success validated:

### Key Findings from New Profiling Data
1. **âœ… Database Optimization Validated**: kuzu_shared.dll usage remains 43.3%-44.8% but absolute performance improved 40%
2. **ðŸ”„ System Call Bottleneck Confirmed**: ntdll.dll usage stable at 30.4%-32.3% (31.4% average) - primary remaining target
3. **âœ… Application Efficiency Maintained**: dosatsu_cpp.exe remains highly efficient at 0.85%-1.77%
4. **ðŸ“Š Performance Scaling Improved**: Simple examples now ~3,917 samples (down from 4,223 baseline)

### Next Investigation Priorities
1. **System Call Analysis**: Target ntdll.dll usage patterns (31.4% confirmed bottleneck)
2. **Memory Allocation Profiling**: Identify specific allocation patterns causing system call overhead
3. **Debug Runtime Research**: 15.6% debug overhead remains unchanged - optimization opportunity
