# Performance TODO

This document outlines the current performance optimization opportunities for Dosatsu C++.

## Optimization Priorities

### Priority 1: System Call Optimization ðŸŽ¯ HIGH IMPACT

**Target**: ntdll.dll operations (31.4% average CPU usage)  
**Impact**: Second largest performance bottleneck with high optimization potential

**Investigation Required**:
- [x] Profile memory allocation patterns to identify hotspots
- [x] Investigate file I/O efficiency and caching opportunities  
- [x] Review string operations for optimization potential
- [x] Analyze system call patterns using memory profiling tools

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce ntdll.dll CPU usage by 25-35% (target: <23%)
- Improve memory allocation efficiency across all example types

### Priority 2: Debug Runtime Optimization ðŸ”§ DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE

**Target**: Debug runtime overhead (15.6% combined debug libraries)  
**Impact**: Development experience and iteration speed improvement

**Investigation Required**:
- [ ] Research optimized debug configurations that preserve debugging capabilities
- [ ] Document recommended development build configurations
- [ ] Test performance impact of different debug optimization levels

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce debug runtime overhead by 20-30% while maintaining debugging capabilities
- Improve development build performance

## Investigation Phase: System Resource Analysis

### Memory Allocation Investigation ðŸ“‹ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Understand what's driving the 31.4% ntdll.dll usage

**Actions Completed**:
- [x] Memory allocation profiling using heap profiling tools
- [x] System call tracing to identify specific bottlenecks
- [x] Correlation analysis between system calls and processing phases
- [x] Identify memory allocation patterns that can be optimized

**Key Findings**:

#### Memory Allocation Patterns (13-14% of total CPU usage across examples):
- **RtlpLowFragHeapAllocFromContext**: Primary allocation function consuming 12-14% CPU
- **RtlAllocateHeap**: Secondary allocation function consuming 1% CPU  
- **Pattern**: Frequent small allocations dominate - typical allocation weights 144k-1.1M samples
- **Debug overhead**: Additional _malloc_dbg calls adding 15k-66k samples per example

#### Synchronization Overhead (40% of ntdll.dll usage):
- **RtlLeaveCriticalSection**: 23% of CPU in complex examples (732k samples)
- **RtlEnterCriticalSection**: 17% of CPU in complex examples (534k samples)
- **RtlSleepConditionVariableSRW**: 18% CPU waiting on condition variables
- **RtlpAcquireSRWLockExclusiveContended**: 18% CPU in lock contention

#### String Operations Impact:
- Heavy std::string usage in templates and hash operations
- String construction/destruction consuming 1% CPU (10k-11k samples)
- Hash map operations with string keys showing frequent allocation patterns

#### File I/O Patterns:
- Minimal WriteFile operations (1k samples across examples)
- I/O not a significant contributor to system call overhead
- Most system calls are memory and synchronization related

#### Critical Section Contention Analysis:
- Lock contention is primary driver of ntdll.dll overhead
- Database operations (kuzu_shared.dll) causing lock pressure
- Heap allocation synchronization creating bottlenecks

### Implementation Phase (Priority Queue)

**System-Level Optimizations (Based on Investigation Results)**:

**Priority 1: Memory Allocation Pool Management**
- [ ] Implement custom memory pools for frequent small allocations
- [ ] Reduce heap fragmentation through allocation strategy optimization
- [ ] Target RtlpLowFragHeapAllocFromContext reduction (12-14% CPU impact)

**Priority 2: Synchronization Optimization**  
- [ ] Reduce critical section contention in database operations
- [ ] Optimize lock acquisition patterns (17-23% CPU in critical sections)
- [ ] Minimize condition variable wait times

**Priority 3: String Processing Efficiency**
- [ ] Optimize std::string allocation patterns in hash operations  
- [ ] Consider string interning for frequently used strings
- [ ] Reduce string construction/destruction overhead (1% CPU impact)

**Priority 4: Debug Build Performance**
- [ ] Minimize _malloc_dbg overhead in development builds
- [ ] Implement selective debug allocation tracking

**Debug Build Optimizations**:
- [ ] Research and implement optimized debug configurations
- [ ] Document recommended development build settings
- [ ] Validate debugging capabilities are preserved

## Performance Monitoring (Future Enhancement)

### Continuous Performance Tracking
- [ ] Integrate performance testing into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Establish performance regression alerts and thresholds
- [ ] Document optimization guidelines for future development

## Available Tools and Commands

### Profiling Commands
```bash
# Profile all examples
python Examples/run_examples.py --profile

# Profile specific example
python Examples/run_examples.py --profile --example simple

# Analyze profiling results
python scripts/analyze_profile.py --directory artifacts/profile
```

### Current Baseline
Performance baseline established from 2025-08-27 profiling data across all example categories (3,917 to 29,767 CPU samples).
