Clean-slate is a a process where one or more documents are cleaned in a partivular way

The documents in question will often contain a lot of historical information, such as:
* Which problems were observed
* Which problems has been fixed
* Which wrong assumptions we had

The above is just a set of examples, but the all have one thing in common:
The information provides very little value towards solving current problems and understanding the current reality

"Clean slate" takes one or more documents and teleports them into the curren time. The documents become as if they have just been written, from a viewpoint of reality as it is now. All on an no longer relevant information is removed from the documents.
Tasks that have been completed are simply removed.
Wrong assumptions are removed
Any the current problems and tasks remain.
