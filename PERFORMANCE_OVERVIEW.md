# Performance Overview

This document describes the current performance characteristics of Dosatsu and optimization opportunities.

## Current Status

### Major Performance Achievement ‚úÖ
**Database Performance Optimization (Priority 1)**: **COMPLETED** with **40% execution time improvement**
- Batch size optimization (25‚Üí150 operations)  
- Connection pooling implementation
- Smart transaction management
- See PERFORMANCE_DONE.md for complete implementation details

### Debug Build Performance
**Current Goal**: Continue improving debug build performance for better development experience, building on the 40% improvement already achieved.

## Current Performance Characteristics

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The baseline measurements below are from BEFORE the database optimization. Current performance is significantly better due to the 40% improvement achieved.

### Remaining Optimization Opportunities (Post-Database Optimization)

**Note**: Updated profiling recommended to get current performance characteristics after database improvements.

| Component | Previous Usage | Current Status | Optimization Potential |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **kuzu_shared.dll** | **43.7%** | ‚úÖ **OPTIMIZED** | Major improvement achieved |
| **ntdll.dll** | **31.0%** | üîÑ **NEXT TARGET** | System call optimization opportunity |
| **Debug Runtime** | **15.6%** | üîÑ **RESEARCH** | Debug configuration optimization |
| **dosatsu_cpp.exe** | **1.3%** | ‚úÖ **EFFICIENT** | Application logic performs well |

## Key Performance Insights

### 1. Database Performance ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Primary bottleneck eliminated**: Database operations previously consumed 43.7% CPU time
- **Solution implemented**: Batch size optimization (25‚Üí150), connection pooling, smart transactions
- **Result achieved**: 40% execution time improvement measured and deployed

### 2. System Call Optimization Opportunity üîÑ NEXT PRIORITY
- **31.0% in ntdll.dll** indicates system call overhead (memory allocation, file I/O)
- **Investigation needed**: Memory profiling to identify specific bottlenecks
- **Potential impact**: Second largest remaining optimization opportunity

### 3. Debug Runtime Optimization üîÑ RESEARCH NEEDED
- **15.6% combined debug library overhead** represents development experience improvement opportunity
- **Investigation needed**: Research optimized debug configurations that preserve debugging capabilities

### 4. Application Logic Efficiency ‚úÖ CONFIRMED
- **Only 1.3% time** spent in application code indicates efficient implementation
- **Conclusion**: External dependencies are the optimization focus, not application logic

## Performance Infrastructure Available

The project has comprehensive profiling infrastructure available:
- **ETW profiling** with etwprof.exe for detailed performance data collection
- **Stack analysis** with xperf butterfly view for call hierarchy analysis  
- **Automated profiling** integrated into Examples runner (`--profile` option)
- **Analysis pipeline** for generating performance reports and recommendations

See PERFORMANCE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md for detailed usage instructions.

## Recommendations for Current Performance Analysis

Since major database optimizations have been implemented, updated performance analysis is recommended:

1. **Re-profile Current State**: Run `python Examples/run_examples.py --profile` to measure performance after database optimizations
2. **System Call Investigation**: Use memory profiling tools to analyze ntdll.dll usage patterns
3. **Debug Runtime Research**: Investigate Visual C++ debug build optimization options

## Current Performance Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Major Achievement  
**40% execution time improvement** through database performance optimization

### üîÑ Next Optimization Opportunities
- **System calls** (31% ntdll.dll) - memory allocation patterns
- **Debug runtime** (15.6%) - development experience optimization

### üìä Current State
**Performance baseline is outdated** - database optimizations have significantly improved overall performance. Fresh profiling data needed to determine next optimization priorities.
